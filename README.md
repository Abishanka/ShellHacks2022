StreetDex is an advanced dynamic search engine which helps return search results for queries for Financial Securities and their Street Indexes. StreetDex utilizes a multitude of technologies including burst-suffix-tree indexing, machine learning utilizing ARS (Accelerated-Random-Search), and Cross-Entropy Loss (completely from scratch) for solving the dynamic model to provide accurate and near real-time search results for massive datasets (containing more than 600,000 data points).

In essence, StreetDex is a search engine which not only takes into account all given initial parameters and provides fast search, but also adapts to user response for improving future results. Given the technology utilized by StreetDex and its base concept, it can also be modified and used as a general purpose search engine because of its underlying technology to provide fast search.
